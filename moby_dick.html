                The <a href="https://www.softcover.io">Softcover</a> publishing platform was 
                designed for ebooks like <a href="https://railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby On Rails Tutorial</em> book</a> 
                and <a href="https://learnenough.com"><em>Learn Enough to be Dangerous</em></a>, but it's 
                also good for making more traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by 
                Herman Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>) We present below a short and 
                affectionately irreverent book report on this classic of American Literature.

            <h3>Moby-Dick: A Classic Tale of the Sea</h3>

                <a href="https://softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Moby-Dick</em></a> 
                by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago–never mind how long
          precisely–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
          particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
          little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of
          driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

            <p>
        After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you),
        Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one
        jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who—<em>spoiler
        alert!</em>—is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
            </p>
